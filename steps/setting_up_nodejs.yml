          - text: First, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. This
              involves downloading from the official [Node.js
              website](https://nodejs.org/) and following the installation
              instructions.
          - text: Once you have Node.js, you'll have access to npm, which is Node's package
              manager. This will allow you to install additional libraries and
              frameworks for your projects.
          - text: Then, create a simple file, say `index.js`, and put a simple 'Hello World'
              JavaScript program there. Run it using the terminal with `node
              index.js`. Voil√†! You're running JavaScript on the server side!
          - text: Take your time to get this setup right, as this is where all the magic
              will happen.
